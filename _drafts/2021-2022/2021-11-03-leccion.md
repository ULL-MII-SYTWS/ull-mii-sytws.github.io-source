## Exercises on Asynchronous JS

* [Generators](https://ull-mii-sytws.github.io/practicas/generators)
  
Generators are function executions that can be suspended and resumed at a later point. Generators are useful when carrying out concepts such as 'lazy execution'. This basically means that by suspending execution and resuming at will, we are able to pull values only when we need to. This exercise ask you to read the corresponding chapter of the Javascript info book.

After reading the chapter, the next exercise shows how 
[Async Await can be implemented using generators and promises](https://ull-mii-sytws.github.io/practicas/async-await-is-generators-and-promises)

## Notes about the Lab "GitHub Cli" 

* [gh cli]({{site.baseurl}}/practicas/06p6-t1-gh-cli.html#extension)

Some of you have already written a [gh extension]({{site.baseurl}}/tema1-introduccion/gh#extension) using Node.JS. Let's have a look at these.

**Instructions about the  delivery**: 

Create a repo for your extension in a repo `ULL-MII-SYTWS-2122/gh-my-extension-name`  inside the classroom organization `ULL-MII-SYTWS-2122`. Add that repo as a `git submodule` to the repo associated to this lab assignment. Just leave the link to the assignment and extensions repos in the campus virtual 

## Lab: GraphQL-Simple-Server

Continue studying the basics of express and GraphQL
